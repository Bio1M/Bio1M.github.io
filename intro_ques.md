MC. What sort of evidence would falsify the statement "All primates
have fingernails"?

* A. A primate that does not have fingernails
* B. A non-primate that does not have fingernails
* C. A non-primate that does have fingernails
* D. A slice of pizza
* E. Either A or C

__Use this information for the next two questions.__  A famous experiment compared bacterial growth in broth that was boiled in short-necked flasks and swan-necked flasks.  Bacteria grew in the short-necked, but not in the swan-necked, flasks.

MC. What is your interpretation of this result?

* A. Bacteria are spontaneously generated in the short-necked flasks
* B. Some bacteria survive boiling and grow in the short-necked flasks
* C. Bacteria arrive from the environment and grow in the short-necked flasks, but are blocked from entering the swan-necked flasks
* D. Bacteria are adapted to grow in short-necked flasks.

MC.  Assume the experiment above was done carefully and correctly, as described.  What is a possible objection to reaching the conclusion above based only on this experiment?

* A. The experimenter may have overheated the flasks
* B. The experimenter may not have allowed enough time for spontaneous generation to occur
* C. The right kind of bacteria may not be present in the laboratory environment
* D. Spontaneous generation may require free air flow, which may have been blocked by the swan-necked flasks
* E. The broth may not have been nutritious enough

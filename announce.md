* Practice questions
* Facebook queries
* Question summary

You may remember that I made some mistakes about page numbers from HHE. These should all be corrected in the complete notes for [apes](/materials/apes.complete.pdf) and for [hominins](/materials/homo.complete.pdf), but I've been hearing whispers to the contrary. _Please_ let me know if anything still looks wrong to you.

* [Notes are available](/materials/UNAME.handouts.pdf) for [the LNAME unit](/UNAME.html). Please print them and bring them to class on Thursday.

* [Complete notes](/materials/UNAME.complete.pdf) from [the LNAME unit](/UNAME.html) are now available. It is recommended that you _don't_ print them, but just use them for reference.

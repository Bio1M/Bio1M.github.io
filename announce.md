Janet Kelso will be giving a public lecture, virtually based at McMaster on Thursday from 1:00â€“2:15 on [__Insights from ancient genomes__](/materials/Sparkuhl21.pdf). It looks accessible, enjoyable and surprisingly relevant. her team is getting genetic sequences from humans (sapiens and otherwise from up to 400,000 years ago, and changing the story of modern human evolution.

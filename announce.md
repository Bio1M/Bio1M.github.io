The two upcoming lecture periods (Fri 6 Oct, Tue 17 Oct) are _optional_:

Friday will be a _technical_ review. We will focus on:

* genotype frequencies, allele frequences and Hardy-Weinberg
* reading and interpreting phylogenetic trees

These technical skills and technical thinking should be generally useful. Some of the Friday material will go beyond the course material.

Tuesday will be a _general_ review. I hope it will be driven by student questions.

The last Dushoff unit will be taught from Thu 19 Oct through Tue 24 Oct.

_Note that, although we are not able to enforce it, regular lectures are_ not _considered to be optional. I (Dushoff) take this seriously, and you should, too._

title: Dushoff test content
---

These guidelines apply only to Dushoff test content (about 45% of your grade)

## Official rules

* You are not responsible for details unless they are in the notes
	* and not responsible for terminology unless it's in [bold]

* You _are_ responsible for relevant ideas and concepts from lectures
and readings

* Conceptual questions, logical inference questions and application questions are fair game

## Guidelines

It is strongly recommended to review relevant parts of the textbook (mentioned in the notes) both before and after lectures:

* the textbook will make more sense to some of you than I do
	* I hope the converse is also true
* familiarity is the foundation for understanding in humans
	* remember the cards and the restaurant

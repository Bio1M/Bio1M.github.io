Since there has been no action on the Facebook group, I made a new Avenue group for discussion of lecture material. It is in [the discussion section of Avenue](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/le/251005/discussions/List) and is called Dushoff content. Feel free to post questions, comments, and to try to answer each other. I will also check in on the group, and invite Jo to do so as well when she has time.

[Notes are available](/materials/phylogeny.handouts.pdf) for [the phylogeny unit](/phylogeny.html). Please print them and bring them to class on Tuesday.

[Complete notes](/materials/speciation.complete.pdf) from [the Speciation section](/speciation.html) are now available. It is recommended that you _don't_ print them, but just use them for reference.

Dushoff midterm content will be _cumulative_, but with more emphasis on material not-yet-tested. Sorry that this was not communicated earlier, and sorry for bad communication between Dushoff and Bolker.

* [The final set of Dushoff complete notes](/materials/hominins.complete.pdf), from [the hominins unit](/hominins.html) are now available. It is recommended that you _don't_ print them, but just use them for reference.

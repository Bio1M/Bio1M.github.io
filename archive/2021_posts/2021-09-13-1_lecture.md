I have set up _two_ meetings for the lecture tomorrow (Tue).

We will finish the intro unit [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3abeeca9fc18da43c78b35e976a2fadd5c%40thread.tacv2/1631568695562?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2244376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%220d80640c-27fb-494f-af0e-30faf02cafb1%22%7d) and the start the natural selection unit [here](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3a950a8e2abc024c8f82b3ba727bca4af5%40thread.tacv2/1631568966270?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2244376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%220d80640c-27fb-494f-af0e-30faf02cafb1%22%7d). The idea is to have each unit have its own channel where you can review Q+A and lecture material. We'll meet in the first spot and then transition to the second spot when the material there is finished.

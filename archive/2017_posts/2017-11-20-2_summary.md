Dushoff's section for Midterm 2 will have approximately 10 points in questions about new material, approximately 3 points in questions about older material, and approximately 2 points in bridging questions that could be placed in either category.

There are new practice questions at the top of the [practice page](/practice.html); answers will be posted later today.

Sorry for delay in posting these resources.

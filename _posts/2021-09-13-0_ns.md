[Lecture notes are available](/materials/ns.handouts.pdf) for the [unit on Evolution by natural selection](/ns.html). Please prepare them so you can take notes on Tuesday.

You can find reading suggestions from the book by scanning ahead in the notes. Most students find that reading ahead increases their ability to follow and to engage in the classroom.

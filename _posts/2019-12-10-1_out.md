Because of Africa teaching responsibilities, I will not be able to respond to Avenue or email questions until this evening.

Sorry if I missed your question (but do check and see if it's addressed on [the Avenue forum](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/about/administrative-links.html#policies-procedures-and-guidelines-for-faculty-members)

Best of luck!

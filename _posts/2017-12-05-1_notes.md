* There are [notes for the Dushoff part of the final review session](/materials/final.complete.pdf), in case you want to take a look. They mostly reiterate stuff that is in the main course material (in a very similar form).

{% comment %} 
* [Notes are available](/materials/UNAME.handouts.pdf) for [the LNAME unit](/UNAME.html). Please print them and bring them to class on Thursday.

* [Complete notes](/materials/UNAME.complete.pdf) from [the LNAME unit](/UNAME.html) are now available. It is recommended that you _don't_ print them, but just use them for reference.

There was a typo in the clade question from my (Dushoff's) part of the exam. That question has been removed from the exam score.

The desired answer was:

`the Three Domains are clades and the Five Kingdoms are not`,

but instead it read:

`the Three Domains are a clade and the Five Kingdoms are not`,

which doesn't really make sense.

My apologies for causing confusion.

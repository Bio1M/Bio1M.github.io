I've had a comment about the short notice for the cumulativeness of the midterm, so I made some changes. The midterm will not have any strictly cumulative questions (i.e., no topics that have not been mentioned since the midterm). But there are questions which you will understand better with a solid understanding of earlier material. Sorry for inconvenience.

* [The final set of Dushoff complete notes](/materials/hominins.complete.pdf), from [the hominins unit](/hominins.html) are now available. It is recommended that you _don't_ print them, but just use them for reference.

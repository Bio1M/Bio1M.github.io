Wed 27 Oct will be Dushoff's last lecture. Fri 29 Oct and subsequent lectures will be given by Dr. Jurek Kolasa.

Dushoff regular office hours will continue for a week or so (stay tuned). Special office hours will be scheduled as appropriate, and the Dushoff office hour channel will be monitored.

Wishing everyone a great term.

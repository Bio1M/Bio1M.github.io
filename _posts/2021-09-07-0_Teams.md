I have set up a [meeting for the Wednesday lecture](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3abeeca9fc18da43c78b35e976a2fadd5c%40thread.tacv2/1631026550850?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2244376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%220d80640c-27fb-494f-af0e-30faf02cafb1%22%7d). 

Please feel free to join early and chat or even meet, but please turn off your camera by 9:30 to save bandwidth. Lindsey and I will mute everyone when we start. Please do not start your own meeting in this channel.

I have disabled "presenting" in the meeting. Please let us know in the meeting chat if you find you still have powers in the new meeting.

We are going to pretend this morning's lecture did not happen! I will start from the beginning tomorrow.

Remember to  watch [Lauren's course-introduction video](https://avenue.cllmcmaster.ca/d2l/le/content/412000/viewContent/3341557/View).

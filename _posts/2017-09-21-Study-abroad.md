There will be an information session this Monday Sept 25th from 6:30-7:30pm in MDCL 3020 about [Operation Wallacea](http://opwall.com/), a network of academics from European and North American universities who design and implement biodiversity and conservation management research expeditions. They have a [partnership with McMaster](http://www.biology.mcmaster.ca/operation-wallcea/) and they sent me a [fancy slide](/materials/wallacea.pdf).

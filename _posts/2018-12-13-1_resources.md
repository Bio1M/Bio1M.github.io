The Dushoff part of the final will have 30 multiple choice questions. Breakdowns are hard (because questions span units), but I estimate approximately:

* 6 focused on Introductory material (intro and ns units)
* 12 on Evolutionary mechanisms (processes, speciation, phylogeny)
* 12 on supplement material (primates, hominins)

I have added practice questions to the [primates unit](/primates.html) and the [hominins unit](/hominins.html).

* [Notes](/materials/hominins.handouts.pdf) for [The hominins unit](/hominins.html)
[Notes are available](/materials/primates.handouts.pdf) for [the primates unit](/primates.html). Please print them and bring them to class on Tuesday.

* [The final set of Dushoff complete notes](/materials/hominins.complete.pdf), from [the hominins unit](/hominins.html) are now available. It is recommended that you _don't_ print them, but just use them for reference.

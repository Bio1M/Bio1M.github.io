* _Thank you_ to the human who pointed out that two of the page ranges in the Hominins notes are wrong (they refer to a different edition of the book)!
	* For Sec 1, please read pp. 238–247
	* For Sec 1.2, please read pp. 271–278

* These changes _will_ be reflected in the complete notes (which will be posted on Tue or Wed).

{% comment %} 
* [Notes are available](/materials/UNAME.handouts.pdf) for [the LNAME unit](/UNAME.html). Please print them and bring them to class on Thursday.

* [Complete notes](/materials/UNAME.complete.pdf) from [the LNAME unit](/UNAME.html) are now available. It is recommended that you _don't_ print them, but just use them for reference.

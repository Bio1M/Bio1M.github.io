Suggested readings for Monday are S1.2 and S1.6 in the textbook. You will usually be able to find suggested readings by scanning ahead in the notes, and I'm not mostly going to bug you about them.

Most of you will find that reading ahead will increase your ability to follow and to engage in the classroom

I will not be able to have my regular Thursday office hours this week (because of a lecture in Psychology that may be of interest to some of you), or next week (because I am travelling to Scotland to do research).

I _will_ have a special office hour this Friday at 2:30 PM, in the usual place (the resource room; BSB 201/A, office D)

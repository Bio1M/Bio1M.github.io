I apparently mixed up two different versions of an earlier test question.

Here is the statement for both questions.

Q Plains zebras live in male-centered groups with 4-9 individuals. Grevy's zebras live in large, well-mixed groups with lots of interactions between males and females.

The answers (depending on version) are:

* We would expect Grevy's zebra to show more sexual dimorphism in _genital_ size because competition for females is more likely to involve sexual competition in that species.

* We would expect plains zebra to show more sexual dimorphism in _body_ size because competition is more likely to involve fighting in that species.

My apologies!

* Early versions of the test, key and scantron key had two of the questions scrambled. This means the original scantron mark was wrong. My apologies (JD). [Corrected tests and keys have now been posted,](/midterm1.html) and new marks are on their way.

* I have judged two of the questions to be unfair. These have been converted to _bonus questions_, meaning you get extra points for getting them right. Therefore, the best possible mark on the MC part of midterm 1 is 30/28.

* [Notes are available](/materials/UNAME.handouts.pdf) for [the LNAME unit](/UNAME.html). Please print them and bring them to class on Thursday.

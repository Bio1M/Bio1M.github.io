If you know the student who crashed their bike into me on Friday, please tell them I'm sorry I yelled at them. I was not aware that the sign saying not to ride your bike up the LSB wheelchair ramp is illegible. It is not obvious how dangerous that area is, and I have requested a permanent sign.

Relatedly, if you ride your bike up the LSB wheelchair ramp â€” don't! It's more dangerous than it looks.

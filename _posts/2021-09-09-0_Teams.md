I have set up a [meeting for the Friday lecture](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3abeeca9fc18da43c78b35e976a2fadd5c%40thread.tacv2/1631237801636?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2244376307-b429-42ad-8c25-28cd496f4772%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%220d80640c-27fb-494f-af0e-30faf02cafb1%22%7d). 

Please feel free to join early and chat or talk, but please turn off your camera by 9:30 to save bandwidth. Lindsey and I will mute everyone when we start. Please do not start your own meeting in this channel.

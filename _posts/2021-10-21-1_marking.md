The variation in mating success problem (23 on the answer key) was submitted incorrectly to Avenue, and marked incorrectly. The course co-ordinator has fixed the problem, but the Avenue crosses and arrows will not be updated, so you may get the wrong idea from the Avenue interface. Sorry about that!

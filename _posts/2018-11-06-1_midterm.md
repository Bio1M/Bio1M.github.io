Thanks to the students who emailed me about the clarity of the question:

* Which of the following processes increase genetic variation in a population?
  
I agree that the question was insufficiently clear (since natural selection _can_ increase variation, although it doesn't _tend to_ like the other two options.

We will therefore (eventually) give credit to people who answered B or C for that question (but not A or D, since genetic drift is an important mechanism for reducing variation).

The process of redoing the grades may take weeks; please don't worry about when it will happen.

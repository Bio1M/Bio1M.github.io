Old midterms do not necessarily have the same coverage; this year has been particularly slow because of internet.

Note that there is old stuff old materials/, in practice/ and in tests/
Deprecate this page; move practice stuff to midterm pages?
Or vice verse; wth do I know??
I think it would be good to move everything to practice, be allowed to delete old materials, and make here the center for review materials (test pages for test logistics and this year's tests).

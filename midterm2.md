title: Midterm 2
---

The Dushoff part of midterm 2 will be _cumulative_ but with more emphasis on not-yet-tested material. 

It's often hard to classify questions, since so many themes overlap, but I would say that a bit more than half of my section of the test relates primarily to new material (since the last midterm).

My section of the test covers material in the complete notes, as well as related conceptual ideas from the lectures and textbooks. To be clear, this means that human evolution _will_ be covered, and slides I skipped for time in my last lecture will _not_ be covered.

The scope of the complete notes is identical to the scope of the handouts, except for the deletions in the last unit.

There are some practice materials below. Note that:

* some content will not be exactly the same; if there's something in an old test that I haven't covered, you will not be responsible for it
* the content _not_ tagged JD in the 2018 midterm is _not_ from Dr. Kolasa, and may not resemble Dr. Kolasa's style of questioning; you should focus more on the JD questions.

This is from 2018, but I later thought it was 2019. Other versions haphazardly ditched or moved 2021 Nov 08 (Mon)

_Note: versions are the same except for ordering; you don't need to study other versions._

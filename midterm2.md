title: Midterm 2

{% comment %} 
The Dushoff part of midterm 2 will _primarily_ emphasize material from the phylogeny and origins units, but may include related concepts introduced earlier. 

It's often hard to classify questions, since so many themes overlap, but I would say that a bit more than half of my section of the test relates primarily to new material (since the last midterm).

My section of the test covers material in the complete notes, as well as related conceptual ideas from the lectures and textbooks.

## Midterm 2

All versions have fundamentally the same content. MCs are scrambled, and SAs sometimes use different numbers (or other trivial changes to discourage copying). You only need to look at your version.

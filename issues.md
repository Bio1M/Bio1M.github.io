Neanderthals
============

Q European humans are descended about 98% from early modern humans, which evolved in Africa, and about 2% from Neanderthal populations that lived in Europe at that time. We might think that sexual competition between males was one of the ways that modern humans displaced Neanderthals, if modern European human populations:

* __shared more mitochondrial DNA than nuclear DNA with Neanderthal populations__
* shared less mitochondrial DNA than nuclear DNA with Neanderthal populations
* showed more sexual dimorphism than African populations
* showed less sexual dimorphism than African populations

I kind of think this is a good question, but I judged it _unfair_ because it requires you to know details about DNA inheritance that I did not spell out in the notes. It parallels the warbler example: if modern males were winning sexual competitions, we would expect to see more survival of genes from Neanderthal females. The mitochondrial DNA comes exclusively from females.

Disruptive selection
====================

Q Which of the following types of genes in humans are known to be under disruptive selection (selection for diversity)?

* Sex-determination genes
* Mating-system genes that control which individuals we find attractive
* Genes that control sexual preference (which gender we find attractive)
* __Immune system genes__
* Genes for eusociality

I kind of liked this question as well, but I judged it _unfair_ because my lectures failed to clear up confusion between the book's definitions of types of selection and my own definitions. The book talks about immune genes as being under "balancing" selection, which could cause students to reject the correct answer.

Peppered moths
==============

Q Researchers raised 100 populations of peppered moths, starting with an equal number of homozygous white and dark individuals in each case.  After 10 generations of allowing 5 pairs from each population to breed in each generation, they found that 50% of the populations were either all white, or all dark.  If this effect is due to genetic drift, what would be expected if they allowed 10 pairs from each population to breed in each generation, for the same time period?

* About 50% of the populations would be either all white or all dark.
* More than 50% of the populations would be either all white or all dark.
* __Less than 50% of the populations would be either all white or all dark.__
* All of the populations would be either all white or all dark.

I don't see any problems with this question. The key is to focus on the difference between the two experiments. The new experiment has _more_ moths, so we expect _less_ genetic drift.

Florin
======

Q The money in the kingdom of Florin consists of bills with the value written on the front, and pictures of members of the royal family on the back. To test the hypothesis that all of the Florinese $5 bills in your wallet have pictures of the princess, you would need to turn over:

* Bills that show pictures of the princess
* Bills that show pictures of the queen
* Bills that show the value $5
* Both A and C
* __Both B and C__

There is no problem with this question. Don't try to memorize anything, but just think it through: if a bill with the queen on the back had $5 on the front, it would falsify the hypothesis.

Stereoscopic vision
===================

Q Which of the following is _not_ a likely reason for early primates developing stereoscopic vision?

* Navigating through trees
* __Avoiding predators__
* Catching insects
* Exploiting new plant resources

Eyes on the side of the head are better for avoiding predators; it's more important to see them than to accurately judge exactly how far away they are. This was discussed in class.

Fitness
=======

Q The lifetime Darwinian fitness of one organism is greater than
that of another organism if:

* it lives longer than the other
* it is able to outcompete the other for access to resources
* it mates more frequently
* __it leaves more viable offspring than the other__
* c and d

This question could be worded better, but I claim there's a single best answer. The first three answers are all _components_ of fitness, and none is necessarily better than another. The fourth answer is a _definition_ of fitness.

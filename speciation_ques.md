MC. Brussels sprouts, kale, broccoli and cabbage were all bred from the same wild ancestor.  Which of the following is supported by this fact?

A. The wild species has a lot of heritable variation

B. The wild species has little heritable variation

C. The wild species is under strong natural selection

D. The wild species is not under strong natural selection


MC.  Three populations of crickets look very similar, but the males
have courtship songs that sound different. This difference in songs
could reasonably be explained as:

A. A prezygotic isolating mechanism resulting from fusion

B. A postzygotic isolating mechanism resulting from fusion

C. A prezygotic isolating mechanism resulting from reinforcement

D. A postzygotic isolating mechanism resulting from reinforcement

E. All of the above


MC. Which of the following is the most significant criterion for
identifying species according to the Biological Species Concept?

a.  Populations are morphologically distinct.

b.  Reproductive isolation between populations.

c.  A strong presence in the fossil record.

d.  The smallest monophyletic group on a phylogenetic tree.

e.  The largest monophyletic group on a phylogenetic tree.


MC.  A researcher notices that in a certain moth species, some females prefer to lay eggs on domesticated plants like potatoes and tomatoes. Other females prefer to lay eggs on wild plants like Datura. In each case, the offspring grow up feeding on the plants where their mothers laid them.  The moths also tend to mate where they feed, and the researcher finds a genetic basis for preference of certain plants, based on scent, in these moths. Based on the above information, what might be occurring in this moth species?

A. divergence in sympatry

B. divergence in allopatry

C. divergence due to vicariance

D. divergence due to colonization

E. postzygotic isolation


MC. What is meant by species _divergence_?

A. When two species are together in the same place

B. When two populations of the same species are in different places

C. When two species or populations are linked by gene flow

D. When one species evolves into another species

E. When one species splits into two species


MC. What outcomes can occur where the ranges of two species overlap?

a.  the species will interbreed, eventually fusing over time

b.  a stable hybrid zone will form if hybrids are better adapted to the area of overlap than either parent species

c.  species will continue to diverge and be isolated by behavioural or
genetic mechanisms

d.  all of the above are possible outcomes

e.  none of the above is a possible outcome


MC. When would you expect to see natural selection for reinforcement mechanisms (mechanisms that prevent different populations from mating with each other)?

A. When the populations are allopatric

B. When the populations would otherwise fuse over time

C. When one population has greater mating success than the other

D. When hybrids have lower fitness when either parent population

E. Under any of the above conditions

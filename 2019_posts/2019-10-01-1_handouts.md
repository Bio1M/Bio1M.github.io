[Notes are available](/materials/phylogeny.handouts.pdf) for [the phylogeny unit](/phylogeny.html). Please print them and bring them to class on Wednesday. I'm sorry that these are so late in the day.

[Complete notes](/materials/processes.complete.pdf) from [the Evolutionary processes section](/processes.html) are now available. It is recommended that you _don't_ print them, but just use them for reference.

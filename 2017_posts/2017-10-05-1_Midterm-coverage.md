The midterm will go only through Section 3.1 of the Apes Unit. This is the amount that was covered in both lecture sections by the end of the day today.

[Complete notes for the Apes part of the midterm material](/materials/midterm1.complete.pdf) are now available.  It is recommended that you _don't_ print them, but just use them for reference.

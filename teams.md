title: Lectures on Teams
---

I am sorry for technical problems, but I feel that our ability to interact is good for me and good for the class. Please let me know your thoughts by Teams chat, Teams channel, or email.

To help things go more smoothly: 

* Please try to join a few minutes early so that the Teams lag can sort out by the time the lecture starts. You don't need to sit in front of your computer or anything.
* The sometimes-social aspect of the lecture chat seems good to me, but please keep it to a minimum between 9:30 and 10:20 to save bandwidth for lecture-related topics.
* The lecture chat is watched by a lot of people in real time; it is not a good place for questions related to tests or tutorials. Post these in appropriate channels outside the lecture, where we can easily find them later.
* If your question is not addressed during lecture, it's a good idea to post it with a topic in channel chat (one level "outside" the lecture chat).

Mic and camera:

* You are encouraged (but not required) to use mic and/or camera before and after lecture to make the channel feel more like a classroom
* Please leave your mic and camera off between 9:30 and 10:20, unless you are called on (or unless it seems urgent)
* You are welcome (but not required) to use your camera as well as your mic if you are called on to talk in class.

title: Unofficial textbook notes
---

_You rely on this page at your own risk._ The official recommendations come from the course co-ordinator, and these notes may apply even less to non-Dushoff parts of the course.

## Textbooks people ask me about:

* Third Custom edition. This is the official textbook, and contains everything you need in a convenient form.

* Third Canadian edition. This is the book on which the Third Custom edition is based. It should have everything you need. The only thing missing is the human supplement, which is currently available to you on Avenue (only, it's not in the Custom edition either).

* Seventh edition. This is the book on which the Third Canadian edition is based. It lacks Canadian content which may be interesting, and may be required for some (non-Dushoff) parts of the course.

* Second Canadian edition (or Second Custom edition). This book has small but important differences in content. Updates to the Third edition have valuable improvements in both science and explanation. Some details that you want may be missing.

* Sixth edition. This book shares the drawbacks of the Seventh edition and the Second edition.

## Other resources

Mastering biology and the Study guide are not required for my part of the course. I can't answer for the other profs. My unofficial advice is to ask older students how useful these are, and try to figure out if they will be helpful for your learning style.
